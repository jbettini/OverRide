# Override
## Overview

Override is a challenging CTF project designed to improve your understanding of binary exploitation (ELF format) on i386 systems. As a continuation of RainFall, this project aims to deepen your knowledge of memory management and vulnerability exploitation through practical tasks.

## Features
-   Focus on reverse engineering and binary exploitation.
-   Hands-on experience with ELF binaries.
-   Payload crafting to gain access and solve challenges.
-   Detailed solutions provided for each level, explaining the concepts and methods used.

## Prerequisites
-   A Unix-like operating system.
-   Basic knowledge of reverse engineering tools and techniques.
-   Familiarity with common vulnerabilities and exploitation methods.
